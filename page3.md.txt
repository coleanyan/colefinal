# Current Job

_Even though I am a chemist and have a company started,_
as of now I am actually an electrician. I got the electrician job
because it paid decent and I needed investment money for my company.
I do like the the electrical blue collar job for learning basic tools and wiring
electricty. It is a good field to have experience in and I will stick with this
until my company takes off or I get an Information technology job after this degree.
I am only an apprentice and not a journeyman yet.
