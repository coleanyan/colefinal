# Chemistry Interests and Background

**I love organic chemistry**. In my freetime I 
practice organic synthesis techniques. I am currently
in the middle of starting a product formulation company
involving cloning gels,and hydroponic nutrients as well as
any other research that is wanted or needed. I have been involved
in chemistry since 2012, and I consider myself a top notch
organic synthesis nerd.

Even though I love chemistry, I typically only want to
do chemistry within my own company so I can stick with research I love
to do. After getting a chemistry degree and studying chemistry
in my free time, I realized I became an expert based on my own
experiments and research and development. School only gave me a basic understanding
of the subject, but did not make me good in the field applications.
I plan on studying and doing research and development chemistry
the rest of my life.
