# Future of Me and Computers

In the future, I plan on being intelligent and efficient
at cyber security, hacking, as well as computer programming and making
websites. If I dont have a career in the computer field, I still plan
on using computers to help my company run efficiently. If my company does not take off,
I would like to have a career within the cyber security or computer programming
area of information technology. Computers are here to stay and I do not see them
going away anytime soon. I look forawrd to learning more and more
and keeping up to date with new techonlogy that emerges. I will do my best
to stay up to date with programming and information technology areas.
I have a strong interest in computers and do not see me changing my studies
anytime soon.
